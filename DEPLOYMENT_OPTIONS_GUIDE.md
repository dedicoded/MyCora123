# MyCora Full-Stack Deployment Options (No Replit)

You can build and deploy the exact same architecture as with Replit—just swap out the hosting and orchestration platform. Here’s how:

## 🏗️ Deployment Pathways

### **A. Render / Railway / Heroku**
- **How:**  
  - Push your code to GitHub.
  - Link your repo in Render, Railway, or Heroku dashboard.
  - Set environment variables for secrets (private keys, API tokens, DB URIs).
  - Deploy backend (Express/Node.js) and monitor logs.

### **B. Serverless (Vercel / Netlify Functions)**
- **How:**  
  - Write API endpoints in `/api` directory within your frontend (Next.js/React).
  - Vercel/Netlify automatically detect and deploy as serverless functions.
  - Env variables managed in dashboard.
  - Frontend and backend live together.

### **C. Cloud Providers (AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions, Azure Functions)**
- **How:**  
  - Package backend logic as Lambda/Cloud Function.
  - Deploy via console or CLI.
  - Use secrets manager for env variables.
  - Connect to frontend and other infra as needed.

## 🔐 Security Practices

- **Always use environment variables** for secrets (supported everywhere).
- **Never commit private keys or API tokens** to your repository.
- Rotate keys regularly and restrict permissions.
