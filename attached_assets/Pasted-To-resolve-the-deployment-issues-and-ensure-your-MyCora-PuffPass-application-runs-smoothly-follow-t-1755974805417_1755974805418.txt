To resolve the deployment issues and ensure your MyCora-PuffPass application runs smoothly, follow these steps:

✅ 1. Fix ENS Name Resolution Errors
Problem: Your code is trying to resolve ENS names (like mycora.eth) during the build, which fails because ENS resolution isn't supported server-side.

Fix:

Replace ENS names with direct contract addresses in your API routes and smart contract interactions.
Store contract addresses in environment variables:
env


1
NEXT_PUBLIC_MCC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourRealAddressHere
Update your code to use the env var:
ts


1
2
3
4
⌄
const contractAddress = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MCC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
if (!contractAddress) {
  throw new Error("Contract address not configured");
}
✅ 2. Disable Next.js Telemetry
Problem: Telemetry prompts during builds cause timeouts.

Fix:

Add to your .replit file:
ini


1
2
[env]
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = "1"
Or run:
bash


1
npx next telemetry disable
✅ 3. Add allowedDevOrigins to next.config.mjs
Problem: Cross-origin requests blocked in development.

Fix:

js


1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
⌄
⌄
// next.config.mjs
export default {
  allowedDevOrigins: [
    'localhost:5000',
    '127.0.0.1:5000',
    '*.replit.dev',
    '*.worf.replit.dev'
  ],
}
✅ 4. Optimize Build Time
Problem: Long build times causing timeouts.

Fix:

Remove unused dependencies.
Ensure no client-side code uses Node.js-only modules (e.g., dns, fs).
Use optimizePackageImports in next.config.mjs:
js


1
2
3
4
5
⌄
⌄
export default {
  experimental: {
    optimizePackageImports: true,
  },
}
✅ 5. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure all required env vars are set in Replit Secrets:

env


1
2
NEXT_PUBLIC_MCC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourRealAddress
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
✅ 6. Update Files as Suggested
Apply the edits to:

next.config.mjs
app/api/token-balance/route.ts
lib/nft-rewards.ts
app/api/pay/route.ts
app/api/onramp/route.ts
✅ Final Command to Run
bash


1
npx next telemetry disable
With these changes, your deployment should succeed without timeouts or ENS errors. Let me know if you need help with specific file updates!
