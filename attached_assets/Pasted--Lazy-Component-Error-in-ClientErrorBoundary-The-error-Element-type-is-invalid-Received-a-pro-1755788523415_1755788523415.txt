 Lazy Component Error in <ClientErrorBoundary>
The error:
"Element type is invalid. Received a promise that resolves to: [object Module]. Lazy element type must resolve to a class or function."

This means you're likely importing ClientErrorBoundary (or another component inside Providers) using React.lazy() or dynamic import() â€” but the import isn't returning the actual component function.
âœ… Fix: Ensure Proper Default Export
If you're doing:
const ClientErrorBoundary = React.lazy(() => import('./ClientErrorBoundary'));

î·™î·š
Then ClientErrorBoundary.tsx must export like this:
export default function ClientErrorBoundary() { ... }


If it uses a named export:
export function ClientErrorBoundary() { ... }


Then change the lazy import to:
const ClientErrorBoundary = React.lazy(() =>
  import('./ClientErrorBoundary').then(mod => ({ default: mod.ClientErrorBoundary }))
);

î·™î·š
Or better yet â€” avoid lazy loading inside app/providers.tsx unless absolutely necessary. Providers are foundational and should be loaded eagerly to avoid hydration mismatches.

ðŸŒ± 2. Environment Variable Warnings
You're seeing:
Missing critical environment variables:
["NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID", "NEXT_PUBLIC_MCC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS", "NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK"]

î·™î·š
But later:
Actual env values:
{walletConnect: "FOUND", contract: "FOUND", network: "FOUND"}


This contradiction suggests your environment check logic is running before the variables are properly loaded â€” or you're checking them in both server and client contexts inconsistently.
âœ… Fix: Sanitize Your Env Check
In your EnvironmentValidator or wherever you're doing the check, make sure you're accessing process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_* only in the client or build-time context.
Example:
const requiredVars = [
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MCC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK,
];

const missing = requiredVars.filter(v => !v);


Also, ensure .env.local is present and loaded correctly. If you're on Replit, double-check your secrets panel â€” they must be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ to be exposed to the client.

ðŸ§¼ Final Cleanup Suggestions
- Avoid lazy loading inside Providers.tsx unless you're wrapping it in a <Suspense> boundary and you're sure the component is client-only.
- Move environment validation to a separate utility and run it once during startup or inside a dev-only banner.
- Use console.warn instead of throwing errors for missing envs in development â€” this avoids crashing the app unnecessarily.

If you want to drop in your Providers.tsx or ClientErrorBoundary.tsx, I can help you refactor it for better SSR compatibility and cleaner startup.
