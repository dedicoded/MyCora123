Crystal clear, t — this is a closed-loop ecosystem, meaning:
- Users earn and redeem rewards, but cannot freely withdraw funds.
- Only verified merchants and admins can initiate withdrawals.
- Platform fees must be transparently baked into the redemption and payout structure.
Let’s redesign the PuffPass redemption flow, mobile layout, and microcopy with those constraints in mind.

🔒 Updated PuffPass Redemption Flow (Closed Loop)

💸 Fee Structure Integration
