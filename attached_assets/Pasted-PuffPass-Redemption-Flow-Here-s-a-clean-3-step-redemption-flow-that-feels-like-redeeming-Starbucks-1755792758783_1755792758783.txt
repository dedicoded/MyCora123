✨ Tooltips & Microcopy (Metaphor-Driven)
Here’s how we reinforce the metaphor in subtle, delightful ways:
| Element | Tooltip / Microcopy | 
| PuffPass Card | “Your PuffPass is like your loyalty card — but smarter.” | 
| Points Balance | “Every tap earns you points. Just like Five Star, but universal.” | 
| Redeem Button | “Turn your points into perks — gift cards, upgrades, or payouts.” | 
| Verify Identity | “One-time check. Unlock premium features across the network.” | 
| Wallet | “Your money, your rewards — all in one place.” | 
| Tier Progress | “Level up your PuffPass to unlock bigger rewards.” |
