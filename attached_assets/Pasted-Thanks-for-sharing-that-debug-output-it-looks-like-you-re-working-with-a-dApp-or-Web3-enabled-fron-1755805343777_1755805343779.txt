Thanks for sharing that debug output ‚Äî it looks like you're working with a dApp or Web3-enabled frontend, possibly using wagmi, cbwsdk, and @appkit for blockchain connectivity. Here's a breakdown of what this log is telling you and how you might troubleshoot it:

üß© Key Issues Identified
1. Connection Status: Disconnected
@appkit/connection_status	disconnected

Ó∑ôÓ∑ö
Your app is not currently connected to a wallet or blockchain provider. This could be due to:
- No wallet connected (e.g. MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Network mismatch (e.g. app expects Sepolia, but wallet is on another chain)
- Connector misconfiguration
2. Empty Chains and Keys
"chains": [], "keys": {}, "account": {}

Ó∑ôÓ∑ö
This suggests that no chain data or user account info has been loaded. You might need to:
- Ensure the wallet is connected
- Check that your app is requesting permissions correctly
- Confirm that the SDK is initialized with the right config
3. Wagmi State: No Active Connection
"connections": {"__type":"Map","value":[]}, "current": null

Ó∑ôÓ∑ö
Wagmi isn‚Äôt tracking any active wallet connection. You may need to:
- Call connect() with a valid connector
- Ensure your wagmi.config.ts includes the correct chains and connectors
4. CAIP Network ID: Sepolia
@appkit/active_caip_network_id	eip155:11155111

Ó∑ôÓ∑ö
This confirms your app is targeting the Sepolia testnet. Make sure your wallet is also on Sepolia, and that your RPC provider supports it.

üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Fixes
Here‚Äôs a checklist to get things working:
- ‚úÖ Verify Wallet Connection
Ensure the user has connected their wallet and granted permissions.
- ‚úÖ Check Network Compatibility
Confirm the wallet is on Sepolia (chainId: 11155111) and your app supports it.
- ‚úÖ Initialize SDKs Properly
Double-check your cbwsdk and wagmi initialization code. For example:
const config = createConfig({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors: [new MetaMaskConnector({ chains: [sepolia] })],
  publicClient: publicClient,
});
Ó∑ôÓ∑ö- ‚úÖ Handle Disconnected State Gracefully
Add UI feedback or retry logic when @appkit/connection_status is disconnected.
