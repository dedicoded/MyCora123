 The Core Error
"Element type is invalid. Received a promise that resolves to: [object Module]. Lazy element type must resolve to a class or function."

This means you're trying to render a component that was imported using dynamic import() or React.lazy() ‚Äî but the import isn't returning the actual component function. Instead, it's returning a module object.

‚úÖ Fix It Fast: Check Your Providers Import
In app/layout.tsx, line 22:
<Providers>


You're likely importing Providers like this:
const Providers = React.lazy(() => import('./Providers'));


But if ./Providers.tsx uses a default export like:
export default function Providers() { ... }


Then you're fine. However, if it uses a named export:
export function Providers() { ... }


Then your lazy import needs to be adjusted:
const Providers = React.lazy(() =>
  import('./Providers').then(mod => ({ default: mod.Providers }))
);

This ensures React.lazy() receives a component function, not a module object.

üßº Bonus Cleanup Tips
1. Avoid Lazy Loading in Layouts
React Server Components and Next.js layouts don‚Äôt play well with React.lazy() unless wrapped in a client boundary. If Providers is a client component, mark it explicitly:
'use client';


And import it normally:
import Providers from './Providers';


2. Hydration Warnings
You're already suppressing hydration warnings ‚Äî good. But make sure your Providers component doesn‚Äôt rely on browser-only APIs during SSR.

üîç Environment Variable Warnings
You're also seeing:
Missing critical environment variables:
["NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID", "NEXT_PUBLIC_MCC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS", "NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK"]

Ó∑ôÓ∑ö
Make sure these are defined in your .env.local or deployment environment. Otherwise, your app might crash or behave unpredictably.

Want to share your Providers.tsx or layout logic? I can help you refactor it for better SSR compatibility and cleaner hydration. You're close ‚Äî just need to untangle this lazy import knot.
