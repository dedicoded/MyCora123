Root Cause
The error occurs because the TypeScript parser expected an arrow function (=>) but found an opening parenthesis ( — which suggests:

A function signature is malformed
There’s a missing } or ) earlier in the file
An async method is incorrectly typed or formatted
Even though async verifyMFA(...) is valid syntax, the error implies that something before this line broke the parser.

✅ How to Fix It
🛠️ Step 1: Check for Missing Braces or Parentheses
Look at the code above the verifyMFA method — especially around class or object definitions.

Example of a broken structure:

ts


1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
⌄
⌄
class SecurityEngine {
  constructor() {
    this.init()
    // forgot closing brace!
  
  async verifyMFA(sessionId: string, code: string): Promise<{ ... }> {
    // ...
  }
}
Or:

ts


1
2
3
4
5
6
⌄
const config = {
  timeout: 5000,
  retries: 3
  // missing comma or closing }
  
  async verifyMFA(...) { ... }
🔍 Fix: Ensure all objects, classes, and functions are properly closed with }, ), and , where needed.

🛠️ Step 2: Correct Syntax for Async Methods
Make sure the method is defined correctly inside a class:

ts


1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
⌄
⌄
⌄
class SecurityEngine {
  // ✅ Correct
  async verifyMFA(sessionId: string, code: string): Promise<{
    verified: boolean;
    remainingAttempts?: number;
  }> {
    // implementation
  }
}
❌ Don’t write it as a standalone function without proper context.

🛠️ Step 3: Add Semicolon or Comma if Used in Object
If SecurityEngine is an object (not a class), you need a comma after the previous member:

ts


1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
⌄
⌄
⌄
const SecurityEngine = {
  init() {
    // ...
  }, // ← missing comma here breaks the next line

  async verifyMFA(sessionId: string, code: string): Promise<{ ... }> {
    // ...
  }
};
✅ Add the comma!

🛠️ Step 4: Use a Linter or Editor with TS Support
Paste the file into VS Code or Replit editor — it will highlight:

Unclosed brackets
Missing commas
Syntax errors
Or run locally:

bash


1
npx tsc lib/security-engine.ts --noEmit
To catch errors without building.

✅ Summary of Fixes
1️⃣
Open
lib/security-engine.ts
2️⃣
Look for
unclosed braces {
,
missing commas
, or
malformed functions
above line 254
3️⃣
Ensure
verifyMFA
is properly defined inside a class or object
4️⃣
Fix any syntax issues and save
5️⃣
Test with
pnpm run build

Once fixed, your build should proceed past this error.
