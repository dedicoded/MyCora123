Perfect! I can see the syntax error in the check-env.js script and the need to set up Replit Secrets properly. Let me help you lock this down with a clean, contributor-friendly setup.

Step 1: Use Replit Secrets
Secrets
Store sensitive information (like API keys) securely in your App
You'll need to add these three secrets in the Secrets tab:

NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID = Get from cloud.reown.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_MCC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = Your deployed contract address
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK = sepolia
Step 2: Fix the Environment Check Script
The script has a syntax error. Let me fix it and make it fail loudly:

scripts/check-env.js
Step 3: Add Clean Development Script
package.json
Step 4: Update Development Workflow
Let me update the existing "Clean Dev Server" workflow to use the new script:

Set
Clean Dev Server
to run
npm run dev:clean
Step 5: Test the Setup
Now you can test the complete flow:

node scripts/check-env.js
Verification Flow
Once you've added the secrets in Replit:

Add secrets in the Secrets tab (lock icon)
Run clean restart: Use the "Clean Dev Server" workflow or npm run dev:clean
Verify setup: Should see ‚úÖ All required environment variables are set
Confirm clean logs: No more [v0] Missing critical environment variables in console
This setup ensures:

üîí Secure: No accidental commits of sensitive data
üßπ Clean: Automatic cleanup of stale processes and cache
üë• Contributor-friendly: One command to get running
üîç Validated: Environment check runs before dev server starts
The environment check now runs automatically before npm run dev, so any missing secrets will be caught immediately with clear instructions on how to fix them.
