You're building your MyCora application on Replit, and while everything is configured correctly, you're encountering issues specific to Replit's environment — like memory limits, port binding, and build timeouts.

Let’s readjust the guidance to match Replit’s constraints and best practices.

✅ 1. Telemetry (Next.js Analytics)
On Replit, Next.js telemetry can cause hangs during next dev or next start, because it prompts for consent — and Replit runs in headless mode.

🔧 Fix: Disable Telemetry
Set this in your .replit file:

ini


1
2
[env]
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = "1"
Or run once:

bash


1
npx next telemetry disable
✅ This prevents hangs and makes your app start reliably.

🔗 Next.js Telemetry Docs 

✅ 2. allowedDevOrigins – Cross-Origin Warnings
Replit proxies your app through *.worf.replit.dev, but Next.js runs on localhost:5000 — so it logs:

⚠️ "Cross origin request detected" 

This won’t break your app now, but will block it in future versions.

🔧 Fix: Add to next.config.mjs

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    optimizeCss: true,
    optimizePackageImports: ['@mui/material', 'react-icons']
  },
  // Allow Replit's proxy domains
  allowedDevOrigins: [
    'localhost:5000',
    '127.0.0.1:5000',
    '*.replit.dev',
    '*.worf.replit.dev'
  ]
};

export default nextConfig;
✅ Prevents future blocking and silences warnings.

✅ 3. pnpm Updates (10.12.4 → 10.15.0)
You saw this warning:



1
2
Update available! 10.12.4 → 10.15.0
To update, run: pnpm add -g pnpm
But you don’t need to update pnpm globally on Replit.

✅ Why?
Replit uses the version defined in your replit.nix or nodePackages.pnpm
Running pnpm add -g pnpm wastes memory and can break the environment
Your current pnpm works perfectly
🟢 Recommendation
Ignore the warning — or suppress it with:

bash


1
echo "Skipping pnpm global update on Replit"
🔗 pnpm v10.15.0 Changelog 

✅ 4. "Module not found" Errors (e.g., framer-motion)
This happens on Replit when:

Dependencies are in package.json but not in pnpm-lock.yaml
Or the build cache is stale
🔧 Fix: Force Fresh Install
In your .replit file:

ini


1
run = "rm -rf node_modules .pnpm-store && pnpm install --force && pnpm run build && pnpm run start"
Or use a script:

bash


1
2
3
4
5
#!/bin/bash
rm -rf .pnpm-store
pnpm install --force
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
✅ Ensures all dependencies (like framer-motion) are installed.

🔗 Module Not Found Docs 

✅ 5. Build Killed (Exit Code 137) – Out of Memory
Replit’s free tier has only ~512MB RAM.

Large Next.js apps with many dependencies (like Web3, Hardhat, MUI) can exceed this limit during next build.

🔧 Workarounds
SOLUTION
HOW
Reduce dependencies
Remove unused packages from
package.json
Optimize Next.js
Enable
optimizeCss
and
optimizePackageImports
Use --prefer-frozen-lockfile=false
Avoids extra checks
Deploy to Vercel
Better memory, faster builds

Example .replit
ini


1
2
3
4
5
[env]
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = "1"
REPLIT_KEEP_PACKAGE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES = "1"

run = "pnpm run build && pnpm run start"
Then run build with:

bash


1
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" pnpm run build
But on Replit, Vercel is better for production. 

✅ 6. Port Not Opened (a port configuration was specified but the required port was never opened)
This means the server started but didn’t bind to 0.0.0.0:5000.

🔧 Fix: Use Correct Start Command
Ensure your package.json has:

json


1
"start": "next start -p 5000 -H 0.0.0.0"
And .replit uses:

ini


1
run = "pnpm run build && pnpm run start"
✅ -H 0.0.0.0 tells Next.js to accept external connections (required on Replit).
